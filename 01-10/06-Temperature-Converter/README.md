# Temperature converter

## Description

This project has been another one that I've enjoyed creating. A temperature converter which converts from Celsius to Fahrenheit and from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

I had to use the !NaN property which is something I've seen before, but never tried it myself until now. This lets me add logic and a fall back to the code so when the program runs with anything that is not a number, the user will recieve a message asking for a valid number.

## Extra info

While the overall functionality of the project will remain the same, the UI down the line may be changed/modified to keep with a theme that I may potentially create in the future.
