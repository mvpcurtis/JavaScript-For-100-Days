# Modal window

## Description

This is a simple project to regarding the JavaScript aspect but DOM toggling is an important concept to drill down.

A simple popup modal window is displayed when the button on the page is clicked along side of a faded out overlay that sits behind the modal to display precedence.

## Extra info

While the overall functionality of the project will remain the same, the UI down the line may be changed/modified to keep with a theme that I may potentially create in the future.
