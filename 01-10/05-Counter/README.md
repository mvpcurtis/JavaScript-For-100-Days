# Counter

## Description

This project is nothing complicated. The program starts by creating a number variable and assigns 0 to that variable. Then once one of the buttons are clicked on the UI (increment, decrement or reset) - their corresponding functions will run and then output the new value of the number variable to the DOM.

Here... I had to work with event listeners ready for when one of those buttons were clicked and localStorage property to store the value of the number variable which is also retrieved when the browser is refreshed so the user does not loose that number.

## Extra info

While the overall functionality of the project will remain the same, the UI down the line may be changed/modified to keep with a theme that I may potentially create in the future.
