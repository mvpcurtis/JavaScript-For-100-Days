# Quote generator

## Description

This project has been more of a challenge than I initially thought. A quote generator using arrays of objects to store both a quote and the source of that quote.

The difficult part of this project was implementing a method to reduce the chance of the random number generator returning the same number twice (which results in the same quote being displayed twice in a row). In order to achive this, I have used a do-while loop which checks if the number for a new quote is equal to the previous number generated.

## Extra info

While the overall functionality of the project will remain the same, the UI down the line may be changed/modified to keep with a theme that I may potentially create in the future.
