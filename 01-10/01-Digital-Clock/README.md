# Digital clock

## Description

This project was a relatively easy one to get finished. A digial clock that displays the current time and updates every single second.

To accomplish this, I used the setInterval function to update the DOM every second and to pull the seconds, minutes and hours I used the Date object which gave me access to the required methods.

While this was an 'easy' project, it gave me hands on experience with the setInterval function and the Date class, both of which I haven't used previously in my own code.

## Extra info

While the overall functionality of the project will remain the same, the UI down the line may be changed/modified to keep with a theme that I may potentially create in the future.
