## Description

This project for me was faily simple one to create. A tip calculator which takes two inputs (assuming a restaurant bill) - the bill total and how much of a percent you'd like to tip. Once the calculate button is pressed, you'll receive back the new bill total and how much you'll be tipping.

To achieve this, I had to work with form input fields, event listeners and DOM output. And some basic maths too ðŸ˜….

## Extra info

While the overall functionality of the project will remain the same, the UI down the line may be changed/modified to keep with a theme that I may potentially create in the future.
