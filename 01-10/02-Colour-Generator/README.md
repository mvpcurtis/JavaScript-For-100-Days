# Colour generator

## Description

This project was personally a really fun one for me. A random colour generator which updates the background with the random colour which has been generated along side of a hexidecimal colour code for the user to copy and use.

I had to come up with a way which would allow me to create a series of random numbers and letters ranging from 0 to 9 and from A to F for the hexidecimal colour code. In order to achieve this, I had to iterate over an array which contained the allowed characters six times adding each value to the current value stored in a variable. From there, it was a simple matter of adjusting the DOM each time the program ran.

Although I understand the concept of for loops, I'm still not completely comfortable using them and when it comes to iterating over an array, I tend to lean more towards array methods but in the moment I was stuggling to achieve the same outcome with a method.

## Extra info

While the overall functionality of the project will remain the same, the UI down the line may be changed/modified to keep with a theme that I may potentially create in the future.
