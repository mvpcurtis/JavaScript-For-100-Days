# JavaScript for 100 days

## Description

JavaScript for 100 days is nothing original and many other have done the exact same thing before me. This is an idea that was recommened by someone I follow on social media.

The idea is to start and finish a project every single day to help improve my understanding and usage of JavaScript. I've changed the rules ever so slightly for myself which will revolve around my life personally:

- To start and finish a project every day. While I may start a project every day, I have given myself some leeway when it comes to finishing that project the same day to accommodate for my lack of time at night throughout a working week. So now if I start a project, I have to finish that project the following weekend.

The entirety of this project will feature many smaller project (starting from easy and gradually getting harder) to help to actually nail the information down in my head by **doing** instead of sitting idly by whilst watching courses and hoping something is going in.
